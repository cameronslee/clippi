# Contribution Guidelines

## Branches
This project utilizes development and feature branches. See [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)


## Commits
This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

#### Sample Commit Message:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

    fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).

    feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).

    BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has the text BREAKING CHANGE: at the beginning of its optional body or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A breaking change can be part of commits of any type. e.g., a fix:, feat: & chore: types would all be valid, in addition to any other type.

    Others: commit types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends chore:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others. We also recommend improvement for commits that improve a current implementation without adding a new feature or fixing a bug. Notice these types are not mandated by the conventional commits specification, and have no implicit effect in semantic versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE, which is NOT recommended). A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.

## Examples
### Commit message with description and breaking change in body

    feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

    BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files

### Commit message with no body

    docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG

### Commit message with scope

    feat(lang): added polish language

### Commit message for a fix using an (optional) issue number.

    fix: minor typos in code
