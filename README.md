A tool for tokenizing moments of interest in videos
```

## Clippy aims to address the two following use cases:

### Tokenizing moments of interest in videos

### Creating descriptions for timestamps
- This will involve a reduce algorithm that can squash nodes (containing a "topic" embedding)

# Stretch goals:
- ui 
- highlight video generator
- auto upload
